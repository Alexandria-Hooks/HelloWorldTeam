A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."
"It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."
"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."
"You love me. Real or not real?""I tell him, ""Real."
"Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."
"If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."
To die will be an awfully big adventure.
"Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all."
"The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."
One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.
We love the things we love for what they are.
I would die for you. But I won't live for you.
"You are, and always have been, my dream."
The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you.
"So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."
Where there is love there is life.
Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary.
